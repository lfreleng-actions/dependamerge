        pre-commit.ci uses the commit status API and sometimes gets
        stuck — either never reporting a status at all, or leaving the
        ``pre-commit.ci - pr`` context in ``pending`` indefinitely.
        Either way the PR stays blocked when that context is a required
        status check.  Posting ``pre-commit.ci run`` triggers a fresh
        run.

        A run is treated as stuck when the status is missing entirely,
        when pre-commit.ci reported ``error`` (it could not complete a
        run, as distinct from the hooks failing), or when it has been
        ``pending`` for longer than
        :data:`PRECOMMIT_CI_STUCK_PENDING_SECONDS` (a slow-but-normal
