        A ruleset can require a workflow that never runs --- most often
        because the workflow lives in the org's ``.github`` repository and
        GitHub queued it but never dispatched it.  The PR then reports
        "Required workflows … are not satisfied" forever, and the wait
        loop spends its entire ``merge_timeout`` discovering that nothing
        will change.

        The answer is always computed against **this PR's head SHA**.  An
        earlier sibling's finding is not reused: absence is a fact about
        one commit, not about the repository, so a workflow missing from
        PR #29's head says nothing about PR #30's.  Reusing it would skip
        a wait that could have succeeded and report a failure instead ---
        and the lookup it would save is a single request, against a wait
        worth five minutes.

        Absence must also be observed **twice**, either side of a short
        delay.  One snapshot cannot distinguish "never dispatched" from
        "dispatched a moment ago and not yet visible"; concluding the
        former turns an ordinary dispatch delay into a terminal merge
        failure.  Two requests and a few seconds is a cheap premium
        against a five-minute wait, and the condition this detects
        persists for hours.

        Returns the names with no workflow run at all.  An empty list
        means either that every named workflow has started --- so waiting
        is worthwhile --- or that the lookup failed, which is deliberately
        indistinguishable here: on doubt, wait.
