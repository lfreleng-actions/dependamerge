"""
Turning the Step 6 dispatch into a terminal ``MergeResult``.

Three outcomes arrive here: auto-merge is pending, the merge landed,
or the merge was rejected.  Only the last needs work --- a rejection
can mask a benign race (the PR merged or closed externally), a PR that
auto-merge will still complete, or a dependabot PR that recreation can
rescue.
