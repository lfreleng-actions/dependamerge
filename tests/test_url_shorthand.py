Tests for shorthand and git-remote target normalisation.

``normalize_target`` runs ahead of every URL parser, so these tests
cover both halves of its job: expanding the abbreviations a human types
and the remote forms git prints, and *declining* to expand anything
else so that the parsers still reject rubbish on their own terms.
