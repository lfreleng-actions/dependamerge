"""
Construction and the asynchronous context manager.

``__init__`` settles the run's configuration and every piece of
per-run state; ``__aenter__`` / ``__aexit__`` own the GitHub client
and the services built on it.

``DEFAULT_MERGE_TIMEOUT`` is imported directly *and* read back
through the package.  The direct import supplies the ``__init__``
signature default, which — exactly as before this module existed —
is evaluated once while the package is being imported and so cannot
observe a later substitution.  Reads in the method bodies go through
the package, where a substitution is observed.
