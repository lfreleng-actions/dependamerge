    Distinguished from every other parse failure because it is

    URL, so no later parser in the CLI's cascade can improve on it.

    Without the distinction the cascade buried it.  ``_parse_merge_target``
    tries the change parser, then the topic parser, then owner-wide,
    then repository --- so a Gerrit topic URL on a host declared as
    GitHub was refused for the right reason, and the operator was then
    shown the *repository* parser's complaint about the name ``topic:``.
