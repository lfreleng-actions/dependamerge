        Recovery for a merge rejected with 405 "Repository rule
        violations found … Required workflows '…' are not satisfied"
        (see :meth:`_merge_error_indicates_pending_workflows`): the
        ruleset-required workflows are still running, so the rejection
        is pending, not terminal.  Alternates between waiting for the
        PR to leave a blocked/unstable state and re-attempting the
        merge, all under one shared deadline of ``merge_timeout`` (the
        same shared-budget pattern conflict recovery uses for its
        rebase/checks phases) so the recovery can never double-spend
        the wait budget.  Each cycle dispatches a *single* merge call
        rather than :meth:`_merge_pr_with_retry`, whose internal
        retry ladder would multiply the number of merge attempts.

        The loop also covers the stale-``clean`` snapshot case (the
        REST ``mergeable_state`` can lag behind or be blind to ruleset
        workflows): when the wait exits immediately because the cached
        state already looks mergeable, the failed re-merge plus the
        interval sleep below degrade gracefully into a bounded
        merge-poll loop.

        Returns True when a retry merged the PR (or it merged on its
        own during the wait); False otherwise, leaving the last stored
        merge exception in place for the caller's failure reporting.
