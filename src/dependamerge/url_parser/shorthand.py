"""
Normalisation of abbreviated and git-remote target forms.

Every parser in this package used to begin by pasting ``https://`` onto
anything that lacked a scheme.  That works for ``github.com/owner/repo``
and fails silently for everything else: ``lfreleng-actions/dependamerge``
became the host ``lfreleng-actions`` with the path ``/dependamerge``, and
``git@github.com:owner/repo.git`` became a hostname of ``git@github.com``.

:func:`normalize_target` replaces that step for all of them, so the
shorthand forms are understood once rather than four times, and the
parsers downstream keep receiving ordinary absolute URLs.

The one genuinely ambiguous case is a two-segment input: is
``a/b`` an owner and a repository, or a host and an owner?  GitHub logins
are restricted to alphanumerics and hyphens --- they cannot contain a dot
--- so a dotted first segment is a host and an undotted one is a login.
Ports and ``localhost`` are covered for completeness.  Repository names
*may* contain dots, but a repository name is never the first segment of
a shorthand, so the rule is not lossy.
