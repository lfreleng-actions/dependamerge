"""
Reading the commit status, and waiting for pre-commit.ci to answer.

The two belong together: waiting *is* reading the same endpoint on a
loop, and both need the same view of what "the status" is --- every
context on the head commit, across every page.

Separated from the retrigger decision in :mod:`_precommit_ci`, which
asks whether a reading means the run has stalled and nudges it when it
has.  Nothing here decides anything; it only reports what GitHub says
and how long it is prepared to keep asking.
