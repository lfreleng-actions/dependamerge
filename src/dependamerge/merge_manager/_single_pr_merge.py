"""
Step 6: the merge itself, or the decision to leave it to auto-merge.

If auto-merge is enabled and the PR is in a state that auto-merge can
rescue (blocked, behind, or unstable), the manual merge attempt is
skipped --- GitHub will merge automatically once branch protection is
satisfied.

We accept any ``mergeable`` value (including ``False``) here for the
same reason Step 5.5 does: ``mergeable=False`` from the API can mean
"definitely failing", "still computing", or "a non-required check
failed".  Letting auto-merge decide whether the failing thing actually
blocks merge is more accurate than us treating ``False`` as terminal.

For ``blocked`` PRs we still consult ``analyze_block_reason()`` to
weed out cases auto-merge cannot resolve (missing approvals,
code-owner reviews, etc.).  For ``behind`` and ``unstable`` we accept
directly: ``behind`` resolves once GitHub re-runs checks against the
rebased commit, and ``unstable`` means a non-required check failed
(which doesn't actually block auto-merge).

Do NOT skip when:
  * force_level == "all" --- force semantics intentionally proceed
    despite the blocked state and must not be overridden by
    auto-merge.
  * the block reason (for ``blocked`` PRs) is something other than
    pending required checks (e.g. missing approvals).
