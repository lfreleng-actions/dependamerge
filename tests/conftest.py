Typed Mock Client Pattern
=========================

Problem
-------
``AsyncMergeManager`` (and ``AsyncCloseManager``) declare their internal HTTP
client as an optional type::

    self._github_client: GitHubAsync | None = None

The client is only populated inside ``__aenter__()`` (the async context
manager).  In tests we routinely bypass the context manager and inject an
``AsyncMock`` directly::

    mgr = AsyncMergeManager(token="t")
    mgr._github_client = AsyncMock()
    mgr._github_client.get = AsyncMock(return_value=...)  # ← warning!

Because the *declared* type is ``GitHubAsync | None``, basedpyright cannot
prove the value is non-``None`` after assignment and flags every subsequent
attribute access as ``reportOptionalMemberAccess``.

Solution
--------
The ``make_merge_manager`` helper (and any similar helpers in individual test
modules) returns a **tuple** ``(manager, client)`` where ``client`` is typed
as ``AsyncMock`` — a concrete, non-optional reference to the same object
stored in ``manager._github_client``.  All subsequent mock configuration
should go through the ``client`` variable::

    mgr, client = make_merge_manager(token="t")
    client.get = AsyncMock(return_value=...)          # ✓ no warning
    client.post_issue_comment = AsyncMock()            # ✓ no warning
    client.post_issue_comment.assert_called_once()     # ✓ no warning

This eliminates basedpyright ``reportOptionalMemberAccess`` warnings without
changing any production code or adding ``assert ... is not None`` boilerplate
to every test.

Guidelines for New Tests
------------------------
1. **Always** use the ``make_merge_manager`` helper (or a module-local
   wrapper around it) when you need an ``AsyncMergeManager`` with a mocked
   GitHub client outside of ``async with``.

2. Hold on to the returned ``client`` variable and use it — *not*
   ``mgr._github_client`` — for all mock setup and assertions.

3. If a test intentionally sets ``_github_client = None`` to exercise the
   "no client" code path, do that *after* unpacking the tuple::

       mgr, _client = make_merge_manager()
       mgr._github_client = None   # intentional for this test

4. If you use ``async with AsyncMergeManager(...) as mgr:`` (which calls
   ``__aenter__`` and sets the real client), you can safely replace the
   client inside the block because basedpyright already narrowed the type.
   You do **not** need this helper in that case.

5. If instead you patch ``dependamerge.merge_manager.GitHubAsync`` and
   drive the CLI end to end, use ``make_github_async_mock`` rather than
   hand-rolling the ``__aenter__`` plumbing.  It mirrors the real
   client's synchronous methods *and* its dict-returning coroutines,
   both of which a blanket ``AsyncMock`` gets wrong.

See Also
--------
- ``tests/test_dependabot_recreate.py`` — ``_make_manager()`` wraps this
  helper with module-specific defaults.
- ``tests/test_precommit_ci_trigger.py`` — same pattern.
- ``tests/test_github2gerrit_detector.py`` — same pattern for
  ``_make_mgr_with_no_gitreview``.

    For tests that patch ``dependamerge.merge_manager.GitHubAsync`` and
    drive the CLI end to end, rather than injecting a client directly as
    :func:`make_merge_manager` does.  Assign the result to the patched
    class's ``return_value``.

    A *single* mock is returned, and its ``__aenter__`` yields that same
    object, because the real ``GitHubAsync.__aenter__`` returns ``self``.
    Splitting it into a separate "instance" and "client" pair --- the
    shape this replaced --- is the trap: ``AsyncMergeManager`` keeps the
    object it constructed and calls ``__aenter__`` only for its side
    effect, then shares that object with ``GitHubService``.  Configuring
    the ``__aenter__`` result therefore left the object actually in use
    bare, and the divergence was invisible because both are mocks.

    Two further details keep the double honest where a blanket
    ``AsyncMock`` silently diverges:

    *Synchronous methods.*  ``invalidate_block_reason`` and
    ``clear_block_reasons`` do not return awaitables, and production
    code calls them without ``await``.  Mocked as coroutine functions
    they leak "never awaited" warnings.

    *Dict-returning coroutines.*  ``graphql`` is declared to return
    ``dict[str, Any]``, but awaiting a bare ``AsyncMock`` yields another
    ``AsyncMock``.  Production code then calls ``.get(...)`` on it,
    which manufactures a coroutine nobody awaits.  That warning is
    reported against whichever line happens to be running when the
    garbage collector reclaims the object, so it points nowhere near the
    cause --- see #420 for how long that misdirection held.  Returning a
    real empty dict keeps the "no repository data" branch honest;
    override it when a test cares about the payload.
