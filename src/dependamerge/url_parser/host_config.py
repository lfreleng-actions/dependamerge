"""
Which GitHub hosts the operator has declared, and which is the default.

Enterprise installs use arbitrary hostnames, so there is no way to
recognise one from the name alone.  Trusting whatever host appears in a
URL would mean sending the caller's token wherever a pasted or mistyped
link points, so a host has to be *declared* before it is used.

Separated from the shorthand expansion that consumes it: this module
answers "which hosts may we address, and which do we assume", while
:mod:`shorthand` answers "what did the operator type".
