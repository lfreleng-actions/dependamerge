        Returns ``(failing, ambiguous, observed)``.  All three are in the
        **workflow** namespace, which is the one a ruleset rejection
        quotes.  A check run carries its *job* name instead ---
        ``.github/workflows/codeql.yml`` declares the workflow ``CodeQL``
        and the job ``Audit Repository`` --- so matching a rejection
        against check-run names compares two different vocabularies and
        misses whenever they differ.

        ``observed`` is every workflow name with a run on this commit,
        passing or not.  A caller reconciling the comma-separated list a
        rejection quotes needs it: the list may be fewer names than
        pieces, and only the runs that exist say which reading is real.

        A workflow can have several runs on one commit: a re-run, or a
        dispatch the concurrency group cancelled.  Runs are collapsed to
        the latest per **workflow identity** --- ``workflow_id``, not the
        display name --- before their conclusion is read, so a superseded
        failure beside a newer success does not read as failing.  The
        rule is :func:`check_runs.latest_check_run_per_name`, shared
        rather than restated.

        Identity matters because GitHub lets two workflow *files* share a
        ``name:``.  Collapsing on the name would let a newer optional
        ``CI`` success hide a required ``CI`` failure, and the inverse.
        Names carried by more than one identity here are reported as
        *ambiguous*: the run genuinely failed, but which of the two the
        rejection meant cannot be established, so a caller must not
        present it as a proven blocker.

        Only completed runs count as failing.  A queued or in-progress
        run has no conclusion and has not failed at anything yet, though
        it still appears in ``observed`` --- it exists.
