        title/commit-subject mismatch (which fails the semantic check
        permanently, so waiting out the merge timeout would only delay
        discovering it).  Avoids triggering side effects in preview.

        ``unknown`` is repaired alongside ``blocked``.  GitHub computes
        mergeability in the background and reports ``unknown`` until it
        has, which is the window a freshly pushed pull request sits in
        --- so the PRs whose checks were still settling, the ones this
        repair exists for, were the ones it skipped.  Acting there is
        safe because the repair's own preconditions do not consult the
        mergeable state: it fires only when pre-commit.ci is a required
        check and its status is missing or stalled, and the title repair
        only when the subject genuinely disagrees with the title.

        One precondition does have to weaken for ``unknown``.  A status
        pre-commit.ci has not reported at all normally counts as stuck,
        but on a PR GitHub has not settled it is indistinguishable from
        one that has not propagated yet --- so treating it as stalled
        would post ``pre-commit.ci run`` during an ordinary propagation
        window, and then wait five minutes for a run nothing was wrong
        with.  A missing status is therefore only stuck once GitHub has
        settled the PR and still reports it ``blocked``; ``error`` and
        aged-``pending`` remain stuck in both states, because each is a
        reading rather than an absence.
