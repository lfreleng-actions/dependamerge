    Dispatches between the local-git path (signature-preserving)
    and the legacy REST ``update-branch`` path based on
    :func:`should_use_local_rebase`.  When the local path is
    selected, REST ``update-branch`` is **never** called — even on
    local-rebase failure — so we never destroy a verified
    signature.  In the failure case we mark the PR as having been
    through Step 5 (so Step 5.5 doesn't double the configured
    ``merge_timeout``) and let auto-merge take over server-side.

    Under GitHub Actions the local-git step itself is refused, since a
    runner has no signing identity; the ``@dependabot rebase`` macro
    still runs.

    Returns a :class:`Step5Outcome`.  ``failed=True`` indicates the
    caller should set ``MergeStatus.FAILED`` and bail.  Two routes
    produce it: the legacy REST path (a raised exception during
    ``update_branch`` or the polling loop), and the local path under
    GitHub Actions, which refuses the rebase with
    :data:`LOCAL_REBASE_UNAVAILABLE` rather than running it.
