"""Rebase strategies for behind pull requests.

This package centralises every code path dependamerge uses to bring
a PR up to date with its base branch before merging:

- :func:`should_use_local_rebase` decides between the local-git
  workflow (preserves verified commit signatures via the user's
  ``~/.gitconfig``) and the GitHub REST ``update-branch``
  endpoint (fast but produces unsigned commits).
- :func:`local_rebase_pr` runs the local clone + rebase +
  force-push-with-lease against a secure temp workspace.
- :func:`perform_step5_rebase` is the top-level dispatcher used by
  :class:`AsyncMergeManager._merge_single_pr` Step 5.  It calls
  :func:`should_use_local_rebase` to decide between paths, then
  delegates to either ``_run_local_path`` or ``_run_rest_path``
  (private helpers).  ``_run_rest_path`` runs the REST
  ``update-branch`` call and the post-rebase polling loop
  (``_poll_post_rebase``) that waits for GitHub to recompute
  mergeability.
- Git network operations authenticate via the ``token`` argument of
  the :mod:`dependamerge.git_ops` helpers (GIT_ASKPASS-based), so the
  token never appears in remote URLs, argv, or ``.git/config``.

The dispatcher takes a :class:`RebaseContext` rather than a full
``AsyncMergeManager`` reference, which keeps the rebase logic
testable in isolation (no need to construct a manager + GitHub
client + progress tracker just to exercise a decision tree).

The local-rebase path is the headline reason this package exists:
``PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/update-branch`` creates a
server-side merge commit whose committer is the calling token's
GitHub user, which is *not* signed with the user's local SSH/GPG
key.  On repos whose branch protection requires verified
signatures, the resulting commit loses its ``Verified`` badge and
becomes un-mergeable.  ``pre-commit-ci[bot]`` PRs are particularly
affected because that bot has no comment macro for recreating a PR
with a re-signed commit (https://github.com/pre-commit-ci/issues/issues/41).
The local path solves this by shelling out to ``git`` so the
user's signing config is honoured.

Layout:
    context: ``RebaseContext``, ``Step5Outcome`` and the tracker shims
    decide: the local-vs-REST gate and its ``BaseRef`` argument
    local_rebase: the local clone + rebase + force-push workflow
    paths: the local, dependabot-macro and REST Step 5 paths
    polling: the post-``update-branch`` wait loop
    dispatch: ``perform_step5_rebase``
